- 👋 Hi, I’m Igor, and I'm a Ph.D. student at NTU, Taiwan. 😊
- 👀 I’m interested in low-light image enhancement and understanding (mainly object detection), learning-based ISP pipelines, and perception based on event cameras and extremely low-resolution thermal cameras (thermopile sensor arrays).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project related to Computer Vision and Image Processing.
- 📫 How to reach me: my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-morawski/).
